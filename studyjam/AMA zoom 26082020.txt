From Srishti Guleria to Everyone:  07:43 PM
Thank you so much for the lab clarification!
There were a lot of doubts 
From Muhammad.Ali to Everyone:  07:43 PM
ok what about if someone isn't able to complete the lab within the allowed time of 60 mins? Is there any way to extend the timings?
From Tam Tolofari to Everyone:  07:43 PM
yes, there is a way
From Arindam Banerjee to Everyone:  07:43 PM
I completed all the labs as per the lab Manual. Now as I am revising and putting more time on understanding each lab component in detail, mostly lab timings are ended before I finish them. I am okay with that but does it replace my previous lab completion records and make it incomplete? 
From Shikhar Chhabra to Everyone:  07:44 PM
@muhammad - you'll get additional 30 mins
From Nilesh_Bhosale to Everyone:  07:44 PM

From Waqas to Everyone:  07:44 PM
Is phase 2 the same udacity ML nanodegree or will phase 2 will be a new dedicated Microsoft azure nanodegree ?

From Bharati to Everyone:  07:45 PM
Is being active in the study group (more in compared to other channels) count towards  community participation?
From Muhammad.Ali to Everyone:  07:45 PM
@Shikhar how we can extend the time?
From varsha gore to Everyone:  07:45 PM

From Anurag to Everyone:  07:45 PM
@Muhammad you get a notification to extend for 30 min
From Aniruddha Humane to Everyone:  07:45 PM
does question-answering and clarifying doubts doesn't count as community participation?
From Muhammad.Ali to Everyone:  07:45 PM
nup. it just stoped
From Tam Tolofari to Everyone:  07:45 PM

From Waqas to Everyone:  07:45 PM

From Rachel Drury to Everyone:  07:46 PM

From Aleem Juma to Everyone:  07:46 PM

posting question posted by Arindam Banerjee 

I completed all the labs as per the lab Manual. Now as I am revising and putting more time on understanding each lab component in detail, mostly lab timings are ended before I finish them. I am okay with that but does it replace my previous lab completion records and make it incomplete? 

From Ray to Everyone:  07:50 PM
raised hand on accident ***
From Akshata Revankar to Everyone:  07:50 PM
please publish a list of students who show up as completed on your list. I do see it as completed on udacity for me.
From Shatakshi Pachori to Everyone:  07:50 PM
@Waqas
I don't think so. Once it's completed, it's saved as that.
From Nuria to Everyone:  07:51 PM
I actually have the same question, we need someone from Udacity to answer to be sure
From Aleem Juma to Everyone:  07:51 PM
that could be fun
From Waqas to Everyone:  07:52 PM
what if I completed a lab previously but then I accessed it to try something new. For argument sake, lets say, I got an error or the results were not correct. Will that lab attempt be counted as incomplete now?
From Mayur Kanojiya to Everyone:  07:52 PM

@Oistamo - You can ask about Phase 2, but they may very likely respond that they don't have the information yet/can't answer that question. - If it's more general/logistical (i.e. when that course starts, etc.), they usually answer those questions. 
From Aleem Juma to Everyone:  08:18 PM
Was it because of time, or was there an error?
