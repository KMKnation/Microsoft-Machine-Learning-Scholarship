However, due to the #50daysofudacity challenge, it was like I had promised myself and I could not come up with any reason to not study for 30 mins. I really really liked that. It helped me get going. 
And I had also taken upon myself to complete the course within the 50 day challenge. So I held a mini study jam for myslef on day 49 so that I can proudly day I completed the course within the challenge.
So thank you, for giving me that support and motivation and instilling this habit in me <3"

 First of all, let me briefly introduce myself, I am a professional in the field of information systems. I have a versatile IT expertise, which has allowed me to succeed in many professional and personal challenges.

Father of two charming children, a 6-year-old girl and a 7-year-old boy, of Moroccan nationality.

 My country, Morocco, is in its peak economic development, it is also a ‚Äúhub‚Äù towards the African continent. I actively contribute through non-profit actions to the training of our young people in the field of entrepreneurship, IT and robotics.
 
One of my great successes of which I am proud, is my participation in the first International Fintech hackathon simultaneously in 5 major cities: Abidjan, Casablanca, Dakar, Paris and Tunis. Organized by the first and most renowned bank in Morocco, Attijariwafa-Bank. The objective of this international challenge was to identify projects likely to contribute to the digital transformation of the bank to reinvent the bank of tomorrow. 420 internal participants and 1,025 external participants from the Attijariwafa-Bank Group having submitted their candidacy, the jury selected 323 participants. I had the immense honor with my team to win the first national prize of this ""Hackathon"" and second at the international level.

 The secret of this overflowing motivation, which allows me to hang on, to learn constantly and to progress, is my children and the economic development of my country. My goal is to create a Moroccan company in the field of ""Data and IA"".  Indeed, Morocco needs experts in this field.

 My IT background, my professional activities in the field of ""Big Data"" and my indirect contribution to the economic development of my country push me towards entrepreneurship.

So it's no coincidence that I signed up for this exceptional initiative, organized by both ‚ÄúUdacity‚Äù & ‚ÄúMicrosoft‚Äù. This is a golden opportunity for me.

Thank you to all the teams who have contributed directly or indirectly to the organization and implementation of this challenge, the latter is a real catalyst for achieving my goals.

 On behalf of my children, my country and myself, I would like to say thank you very much."

 My country, Morocco, is in its peak economic development, it is also a ‚Äúhub‚Äù towards the African continent. I actively contribute through non-profit actions to the training of our young people in the field of entrepreneurship, IT and robotics.
 
One of my great successes of which I am proud, is my participation in the first International Fintech hackathon simultaneously in 5 major cities: Abidjan, Casablanca, Dakar, Paris and Tunis. Organized by the first and most renowned bank in Morocco, Attijariwafa-Bank. The objective of this international challenge was to identify projects likely to contribute to the digital transformation of the bank to reinvent the bank of tomorrow. 420 internal participants and 1,025 external participants from the Attijariwafa-Bank Group having submitted their candidacy, the jury selected 323 participants. I had the immense honor with my team to win the first national prize of this ""Hackathon"" and second at the international level.

 The secret of this overflowing motivation, which allows me to hang on, to learn constantly and to progress, is my children and the economic development of my country. My goal is to create a Moroccan company in the field of ""Data and IA"".  Indeed, Morocco needs experts in this field.

 My IT background, my professional activities in the field of ""Big Data"" and my indirect contribution to the economic development of my country push me towards entrepreneurship.

So it's no coincidence that I signed up for this exceptional initiative, organized by both ‚ÄúUdacity‚Äù & ‚ÄúMicrosoft‚Äù. This is a golden opportunity for me.

Thank you to all the teams who have contributed directly or indirectly to the organization and implementation of this challenge, the latter is a real catalyst for achieving my goals.

 On behalf of my children, my country and myself, I would like to say thank you very much."
