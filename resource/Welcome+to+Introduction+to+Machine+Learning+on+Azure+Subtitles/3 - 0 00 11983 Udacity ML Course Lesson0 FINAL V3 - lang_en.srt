00:00:09,530 --> 00:00:14,280
Hello and welcome to the Introduction to Machine Learning course.

2
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:16,260
I am Aniththa Umamahesan and I'm

3
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:19,440
a Program Manager on the Azure Machine Learning team here at Microsoft.

4
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:22,120
Let me introduce you to my team of instructors.

5
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:24,420
Thank you Ani. I'm Abraham Omorogbe.

6
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:28,605
I am also a Program Manager on the Azure Machine Learning team here at Microsoft.

7
00:00:28,605 --> 00:00:30,420
Hi, I am Ciprian Jichici,

8
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:33,090
recognized as a Microsoft Regional Director and

9
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:36,030
most valuable professional in artificial intelligence.

10
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:39,795
I've been spending my last 20 years studying machine learning.

11
00:00:39,795 --> 00:00:44,660
I'm Zoiner Tejada. I'm also recognized as a Microsoft Regional Director and MVP in AI,

12
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:47,840
and I spent my last 20 years working in data and AI.

13
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:52,430
This course provides an introduction to the fantastic world of machine learning.

14
00:00:52,430 --> 00:00:56,765
Our aim is to provide a low code introductory approach to this topic.

15
00:00:56,765 --> 00:00:58,340
You should consider the course as

16
00:00:58,340 --> 00:01:02,360
a low friction introduction to more complex courses or nano degrees.

17
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:04,145
Throughout the course, we will use

18
00:01:04,145 --> 00:01:07,570
Azure Machine Learning studio to run the examples and the labs.

19
00:01:07,570 --> 00:01:11,330
We'll start by helping you understand the overall place of the field in

20
00:01:11,330 --> 00:01:15,190
the broader context of computer science by taking you through the history,

21
00:01:15,190 --> 00:01:18,905
prospective, approaches, challenges, essential tools,

22
00:01:18,905 --> 00:01:20,705
and the fundamental processes.

23
00:01:20,705 --> 00:01:23,360
Next we'll focus on core machine learning process.

24
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:24,620
Training a model.

25
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:29,870
The entire chain of task is covered from data important transformations to training,

26
00:01:29,870 --> 00:01:32,525
validating, and evaluating the model.

27
00:01:32,525 --> 00:01:35,150
This being an introductory course,

28
00:01:35,150 --> 00:01:37,385
we focus on laying the foundations.

29
00:01:37,385 --> 00:01:39,500
We will talk about both supervised,

30
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:45,109
like classification and regression and unsupervised, like clustering approaches.

31
00:01:45,109 --> 00:01:46,730
Building on these basics,

32
00:01:46,730 --> 00:01:52,115
more advanced techniques like ensemble learning and deep learning are also covered.

33
00:01:52,115 --> 00:01:56,990
You won't miss either some of the best known specific cases of machine learning,

34
00:01:56,990 --> 00:02:00,365
like recommendations, text classification,

35
00:02:00,365 --> 00:02:04,280
anomaly detection, forecasting, or feature learning.

36
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:07,970
To make all these work at their best in the real world,

37
00:02:07,970 --> 00:02:11,480
you will most likely need to deal with one or more sets of

38
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:13,430
managed services that enable

39
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:17,464
efficient and scalable approaches to data and model management,

40
00:02:17,464 --> 00:02:21,635
compute resources allocation, and operationalization.

41
00:02:21,635 --> 00:02:24,140
As we already mentioned in this course,

42
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:30,065
Azure Machine Learning will be used as an example of such a managed services platform.

43
00:02:30,065 --> 00:02:32,690
The course will end with a lesson on

44
00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:35,795
the broader implications and impact of machine learning.

45
00:02:35,795 --> 00:02:39,680
We'll briefly introduce you to some of the challenges the field faces these days,

46
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:43,055
and we'll cover topics related to responsible artificial intelligence,

47
00:02:43,055 --> 00:02:47,290
such as transparency, expandability, and fairness.

48
00:02:47,290 --> 00:02:50,950
We hope you enjoy this course.
