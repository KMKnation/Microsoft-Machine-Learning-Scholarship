	First time in ML/DL, I experienced design studios like Android Studio and XCode, Kudos to the team of @Microsoft Azure to come up with such drag and drop concept that will help the non-coding background people :+1::clapping-inclusive::clapping-inclusive::clapping-inclusive:
	Attached: Android Studio's drag and drop design studio for reference.
	Also learned, how RDP gateway works in the browser. :face_with_monocle:
